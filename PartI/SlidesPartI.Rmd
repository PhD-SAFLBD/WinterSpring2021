# What this part is about

- Learning C++ for speed and scalability issues 

- Learning how to compute Machine/Deep Learning models through approximation and estimation

- Other useful computational techniques and estimation approaches
 
- Learning important details about computing models
---
#What I need to succeed in this course

- Calculus & Linear Algebra deep understanding  ([Youtube Lectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVKj3LADCnA&list=PL1C2ABAE35DE06898), [Textbook](https://www.amazon.fr/Linear-Algebra-Matrix-Analysis-Statistics/dp/1420095382))

- General understanding of statistical modeling 

- Previous coding experience and willingness to spend some time learning as I go

#What I will cover in this part

- Basic computing

- C++ & Advanced R coding

- Optimization

- Numerical and empirical modeling

- Machine/Deep learning
  - Supervised learning (*generative/discriminative learning, parametric/non-parametric learning, neural networks, support vector machines*); 
  - Unsupervised learning (*clustering, dimensionality reduction, kernel methods*); 
  - Learning theory (*bias/variance tradeoffs, practical advice*); 
  - Reinforcement learning and adaptive control.

#Course materials

- Scientific computing with C++

  - Everything I use in this course is freely available [here](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs106b/schedule.html) and it is scheduled following 7 weeks with one assignement ([problem set](https://github.com/heavy3/programming-abstractions)) per week.

-  Machine learning and statistical pattern recognition, [this course](http://cs229.stanford.edu/syllabus-spring2020.html) is scheduled following 10 weeks with one assignement ([problem set](https://github.com/ccombier/stanford-CS229)) per week
 
- Additional resources

 - Advanced R [here](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/)

 - R and C++ Integration with Rcpp [here](https://www.amazon.fr/Seamless-Integration-Rcpp-Dirk-Eddelbuettel/dp/1461468671)

 - Deep Learning with R [here](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-R-Francois-Chollet/dp/161729554X)

#What I have to do

- Follow lectures schedule 

- 12 computational problem sets + code review (7 for C++ & 5 for Machine/Deep Learning)

- 2 Personal projects reports ( C++ programming project + Machine Learning project applied to a chosen field)
